## About
Rhinoceros (Rhino) is a commercial software for three-dimensional NURBS modeling developed by Robert McNeel & Associates. It is primarily used in industrial design, architecture, ship design, jewelry and automotive design, CAD/CAM design, rapid prototyping, reverse engineering, as well as in multimedia and graphic design.

A model created in Rhino demonstrates NURBS surfaces (Flamingo Rendering). Rhino specializes in NURBS modeling. Plugins developed by McNeel include Flamingo (raytrace rendering), Penguin (photorealistic rendering), Bongo (animation), and Brazil (complex rendering). There are over a thousand third-party plugins for Rhino. Like many other modeling programs, Rhino has its own scripting language based on Visual Basic, and the SDK allows reading and writing files directly.
